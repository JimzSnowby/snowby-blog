const e=`<h1>Working On Mindset - Part 2</h1>
<p>After a week of sticking to my new daily schedule and reflecting on my strengths and values, life feels easier. The guilt I used to feel when not job hunting has faded significantly. While things are still a work in progress, I have a renewed energy I haven’t felt in a long time. Taking time to reflect on daily accomplishments has given me a clearer focus for the next day. Following the schedule keeps me productive, helps me stick to task-specific time blocks, and allows me to fully &quot;switch off&quot; without guilt creeping into other activities.</p>
<h2>Mindset coaching session 2</h2>
<p>I was excited for the second session, eager to keep improving my mindset. After discussing how I felt after the first session, we explored my strengths and weaknesses from my strengths profile and reviewed the saboteurs identified in last week’s quiz. Two key strengths that stood out were adaptability and resilience, qualities I hadn’t thought to highlight in interviews. A great example of my resilience is completing my welding and fabrication apprenticeship, it was a challenge to reach the end as I didn't enjoy it, but I pushed through and came out with a great qualification, a trade skill, and most importantly, life experience.</p>
<p>My biggest saboteur is &quot;avoidance,&quot; which fuels procrastination. I often face option paralysis, leading to procrastination and then anxiety about the delayed task. So, how can I break this cycle? With my coach’s guidance, I realized I perform best outside my comfort zone. This ties back to my resilience—when I set a goal, the goal remains constant, no matter the day-to-day challenges. I adapt to changes to stay on track. While these changes can be stressful, that small stress is what pushes me into my most effective state of mind. This realisation has shown me that I have been in my comfort zone for too long, and now my confidence and performance has suffered. Growth can't come when you're in the comfort zone.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>My next goals are to practice stepping out of my comfort zone more and to continue reflecting to maintain a positive mindset. After this session, I’ve learned so much about myself that I hadn’t considered before. I now know how to use my strengths effectively and have a deeper understanding of them. This understanding also allows me to explain to others why these are my strengths and how I’ve used them in the past.</p>
