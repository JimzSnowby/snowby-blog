const t=`<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>Welcome to my blog! My name is James, a Computer Science graduate from Northumbria University.</p>
<p>My main goal with this website is for it to act as a portfolio to show what I am currently working on, as well as being an outlet to help me work through my thoughts,
and help make my job hunting a little bit more engaging.</p>
<p>Currently, I am trying to improve my writing, as it is not the best, often becoming wordy, which is probably a side effect of me trying to hit word counts during my assessment writing (whoops), but through writing more of these articles I aim to improve my writing ability and help make my messages concise and easy-to-understand.</p>
<p>So whilst working on improving my communication skills, I would like to share my journey with you. On the <strong>About</strong> page (once I get around to finishing it!), you will find more in-depth information about who I am, what my background is, and what my career goals are.</p>
<p>For now, I will be writing about the technical details of this web page and I will be structuring future <strong>project articles</strong> in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project aims</li>
<li>Technology used/considered as well a justification for those choices</li>
<li>The approach I will be taking/took</li>
</ul>
<p>And then for any finished projects or updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>What could be improved?</li>
<li>What did I learn?</li>
<li>How happy I am with the outcome?</li>
</ul>
<p>This structure will most likely change as I write more and experiment with different approaches, but for now I'm confident that this is a good starting point.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you have made it this far, thank you for reading!</p>
