const e=`<h1>Working On Mindset - Part 3</h1>
<p>After another week of following my schedule, I’ve improved my physical health by starting morning runs. However, some time slots were a bit arbitrary, so I adjusted them into smaller, manageable chunks to use the Pomodoro technique and removed ones I wasn’t sticking to. With the holiday season approaching, opportunities to push beyond my comfort zone have been limited. Still, I’ve made a conscious effort to use the phone more, something I have always found challenging, and have grown noticeably more confident in my phone skills.</p>
<h2>Mindset coaching session 3</h2>
<p>For this session, I wanted to focus on improving my business communication skills to boost my employability. This goal came after feedback from recent interviews and assessments pointing out a lack of awareness in this area. On a more personal note, I’ve been struggling with &quot;brain fog,&quot; where I feel like I’ve &quot;floated&quot; through conversations or activities, making it hard to stay fully engaged. I know this stems from my mental well-being, and I’m working to address it (hence the mindset coaching).</p>
<p>My coach suggested I try &quot;active listening&quot; to address my brain fog. I wasn’t familiar with the concept, but techniques like asking questions mid conversation, summarizing what the speaker said, or repeating what someone says felt like a practical solution to my problem.</p>
<p>We also built on the last session by focusing on selling myself. We explored how to talk through my skills with clear, relatable examples using the STAR method in order to break down my strengths into actionable steps. This preparation will help me approach interviews with more confidence and leave a stronger impression on interviewers.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>There is a decent amount to unpack from this session. I am excited about putting active listening into action, as this brain fog is somehing that I have had some concerns about for a little while now, and this definitely something that could help. The idea of the STAR bank is also great, as it will help me get a better understanding of my strengths, as well as help e prepare for interviews, allowing me to go into them with confidence.</p>
