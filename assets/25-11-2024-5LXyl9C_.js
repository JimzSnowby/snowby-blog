const e=`<h1>Making a game</h1>
<p>For years I have messed around with different game engines and 3D modelling with the hope of making a game some day. After starting countless projects only to abandon them a month or so later, I have yet to actually finish any of these ideas I had for a game. So in an attempt to break this cycle, I will be focusing on completing a functional game that I would be happy to share to the public. For this, I will be putting more focus on project structure and deadlines, whilst making a developer log to help me keep on track and hopefully finish this project.</p>
<h2>Project Aims</h2>
<p>To make a game! Or more specifically, to make a complete game that can be &quot;shipped&quot;. This doesn't mean pushing out another shovelware title that can be found on the app store or other game marketplaces, but a game that people can see has some actual effort put into it and that they would actually be willing to play and enjoy.</p>
<p>The game will initially be made with just the PC in mind, however I will make sure that the design can be changed to work for other platforms like mobile in the future if I want to go that extra step. It will also be very simple in scope, a 3D platform game with collectables and different platforming challenges. Things like mechanics will be discussed in a future post.</p>
<h2>Technology and Reasoning</h2>
<p>To make this game, I need to pick technology that I am most comfortable using and has good community support.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Godot</strong>:
A free, open-source game engine that is released under the permissive <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/LICENSE.txt">MIT license</a>. This engine has become very popular in the indie game community within the last couple of years due to its open-source nature and Python-like GDScript language. I have used this engine the most when compared to Unreal Engine or Unity, mainly due to the simplicity and its very good documentation. Specifically, I will be using the C# version of the engine due to having better performance but also because of wanting to improve my C# skills.

<li><strong>Blender</strong>:
Anyone who has ever looked at 3D modelling software will know that this is a given. Not only is it free and open-source, but Blender has been around for almost 3 decades, with its first release being in 1995, and with this long life span, the community surrounding it is huge. Traditional, &quot;professional&quot; 3D software such as 3Dsmax and Maya are also notoriously expensive, which makes this an easy choice. I have messed around with Blender for about 2 decades now, so I am pretty comfortable with the software, although I wouldn't go as far as to say I am a pro with it.

</ul>
<p>For now this is all I will be using, but no doubt as I progress I will need other software such as Reaper for sound and music, and Krita or Gimp for textures and materials. Once these come in use, there will be a future post that discusses them.</p>
<h2>Approach</h2>
<p>As previously mentioned, the scope will be kept small, as making a game is a huge undertaking. The current plan is to make a 3D platformer, mainly taking inspiration from Mario Odyssey. Most of the focus will be on making the control and platforming mechanics fun and engaging, which is the make or break factor for such a simple style of game. Poor control is frustrating for the player, and bad mechanics will make it feel unfair. The first steps for the game are setting up the Godot project and getting these controls and player character working, which the next post on this topic will focus on.</p>
