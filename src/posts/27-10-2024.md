# Building my website

## Project aims
To build this website! The goal is to create a simple portfolio/blog that showcases who I am. This project will allow me to post individual articles and display them in an easy-to-use layout, and there will also be components that lead to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles, as well as a page that gives visitors a background into who I am.

The project needs to be scalable, allowing me to add new features in the future without affecting the rest of the website, and also needs to have a responsive design, meaning it is viewable on all browsers, as well as pc's, phones, and tablets.

## Technology
This website is built using:
